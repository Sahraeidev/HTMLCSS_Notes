<h2>What is a Framework?</h2>
<p>A framework is a collection of pre-written code that helps you build projects more easily and quickly.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download it and include the files in your project locally.</li>
    <li>Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network): a hosted version you can include by copying and pasting a link into your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</li>
    <li>Include it via JavaScript (optional, for components that require JS behavior).</li>
</ol>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
